Here are some "poems" I wrote with the help of this program. They seem to make just as much sense as regular poetry, if not more. Lines beginning with `>` were my contributions:

```
Fare, from me, whose sheets only another;
> for I have to clean the sheets of my dead mother!
it is the start-window-wheel disday
> and I must ensure not to cause dismay.
Cross the tide. You falls adains.
> The tides are now growing stronger,
uneven and fierceal, laboured, calm belied:
> and then suddenly, I was on shore.
Uplass !ill you call the woods the leases
> which we cannot retract but only sublet.
```

```
> Roses are red
In broken drift of skin
> not attached to body.

Death's fresk predect,
> man's most perfect defect,
For Then.
>     
Of alas! yes, no, though brassies
> might never store a boolean.

Up, Knock, sorrow, all my well!
> Down, flock, morrow, all you tell!
Her two diviner's smatter!
> And his three sinners splatter!
Love, can fear her big your fate
> but not your mate.
```

```
In griming in the current on
> the seas off of London,
And the thing gives ye within home bereat,
> yet does not feel like a nice treat.

They starter brother,
> and ended mother,
We live of my naily year be:
> that he may one day see!

Do yoke, I lived hy oaked will not die
> because he's killed by a spy!   
Left and follets as the kingdom of cow,
> and the queendom of tao,
Just recolfing a hollyronness
> and making up other silly words.
```

```
When I might pray to be lovin' togethe
> with you and not any othe.
We pay you but a moment. How should have roam
> the lands doth done.

A wood takes you have you till tepart arrayed
> in a linear fashion along the shore.
Plead by the soul.
> Bleed by the sword.

Me wears that word where more excettion trudy.
> Me hears that turd which gives exception truly!
Die to the joy's eye Virtue?
> Or live to the boy's pride a statue.
