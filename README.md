Here are some "poems" I wrote with the help of this program. They seem to make just as much sense as regular poetry, if not more. Lines beginning with `>` were my contributions:

```
Fare, from me, whose sheets only another;
> for I have to clean the sheets of my dead mother!
it is the start-window-wheel disday
> and I must ensure not to cause dismay.
Cross the tide. You falls adains.
> The tides are now growing stronger,
uneven and fierceal, laboured, calm belied:
> and then suddenly, I was on shore.
Uplass !ill you call the woods the leases
> which we cannot retract but only sublet.
```

In broken drift of skin

Death's fresk predect,

For Then.

Of alas! yes, no, though brassies

Up, Knock, sorrow, all my well!
> Down, flock, morrow, all you tell!
Her two diviner's smatter!
> And his three sinners splatter!
Love, can fear her big your fate

Here's some poems I let the net write on its own:

```
Snow past the spirit blind befined,
I didn't in the old roof world!
the Walling of the valley,

The sun is servingly, and by the borth
Can find a living of the made hidverly
Had fled, of wealth of silver winds
Or a disery roff and opbisless?

Both out if the wild-pounding scit.

How maches back to kill that stone depress,
Red clay whats could revell for words.
```

```
So, my beats that I write she silent,
To thee unhappy as blue-'disal
The hills of the season may nirr
Just wait his blood with the both may read
a-weaffird human hast in the storm.
only I told he plashes your door--pates, alad!
Nor to his eyes when out of he is!
He pursue the valiant futter bad doth in death,
Because through marter-full contravious part,
E'en makes unifout that you've find to guez,
Leaving you alrost life . . . here was in
:
and he'll died -- the wail will be!"
And . . . and repited Unsayl's" (While be still,
Join' old words youth above the dere devantive.
Sea-foundest found it some sweet painted,
Sea made me growing guint escaped by;
I demicing sickness of the feel's abtorted :
I may not from the veil dread;
With cod clear as a shell
```

```
I'm just a school, my fear expine,
Where I will not leap, my love,
When one my keftless age,
And seement you rest again,

I must live my frazelly keen.'

Wade, I enter we must be,
Nor did reaches in hands
That selflic eyes, and Death.

'Tis mine own fire doth remember
The secon must enchant;
A cloudless name as they green'
Let me thy heart the hurranest orient,
Lest this are seen be bearned.
